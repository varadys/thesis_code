# thesis_code

The files in this repository include the code used to build the tables and plots in my senior undergraduate thesis for the department of Biology at Reed College. The cell_density file includes the calculation used to derive the linear regression model used to assign cell count to absorbance values in spectrophotometer measurements. This is the only equation derived from the coding files.
